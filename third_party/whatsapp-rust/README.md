# whatsapp-rust

[![CodSpeed](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://codspeed.io/badge.json)](https://app.codspeed.io/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust?utm_source=badge)

A high-performance, async Rust library for the WhatsApp Web API. Inspired by [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) (Go) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) (TypeScript).

## Features

- **Authentication** — QR code pairing, pair code linking, persistent sessions
- **Messaging** — E2E encrypted (Signal Protocol), 1-on-1 and group chats, editing, reactions, quoting, receipts
- **Media** — Upload/download images, videos, documents, GIFs, audio with automatic encryption
- **Voice calls** — 1:1 VoIP audio calls with built-in MLOW or external encoded Opus/MLOW; see the
  [codec boundary and production profiles](agent_docs/voip_audio_codecs.md)
- **Groups & Communities** — Create, manage, invite, membership approval, subgroup linking
- **Newsletters** — Create, join, send messages, reactions
- **Status** — Text, image, and video status posts with privacy controls
- **Contacts** — Phone number lookup, profile pictures, user info, business profiles
- **Presence & Chat State** — Online/offline, typing indicators, blocking
- **Chat Actions** — Archive, pin, mute, star messages
- **Profile** — Set push name, status text, profile picture
- **Privacy** — Fetch/set privacy settings, disappearing messages
- **Modular** — Pluggable storage, transport, HTTP client, and async runtime; SQLite, Tokio WebSocket, and ureq ship as the defaults, swap any of them with `default-features = false`
- **Native plugins** — Build-time, type-safe extensions with scoped capabilities and lifecycle ownership behind the `plugins` feature
- **Runtime agnostic** — Bring your own async runtime via the `Runtime` trait (Tokio included by default)

## Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
whatsapp-rust = "0.7"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread", "signal"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use whatsapp_rust::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let bot = Bot::builder()
        .with_backend(SqliteStore::new("whatsapp.db").await?)
        .on_qr_code(|code, _timeout| async move {
            println!("Scan to pair:\n{code}");
        })
        .on_message(|ctx| async move {
            if ctx.message.text_content() == Some("ping") {
                let _ = ctx.reply("pong").await;
            }
        })
        .build()
        .await?;

    // Runs until logout or shutdown; a single await.
    bot.run().await;
    Ok(())
}
```

The default cargo features wire up the Tokio WebSocket transport, the ureq HTTP client, the SQLite store, and the Tokio runtime; only the storage backend has to be chosen explicitly. Every piece is replaceable through the builder (`with_transport_factory`, `with_http_client`, `with_runtime`) for custom environments such as wasm or embedded targets.

Native plugin APIs are opt-in: use `features = ["plugins"]` when implementing a
plugin in the application. Published plugin crates can enable that feature in
their own `whatsapp-rust` dependency, and Cargo feature unification activates it
for the consumer. See [`agent_docs/plugin_architecture.md`](agent_docs/plugin_architecture.md)
for the host contract and type-safe API example.

### Codegen flags

The crate sets no `target-feature`, because a published library cannot know
which CPU it will run on and such a flag has no runtime fallback. A binary built
with one dies with `SIGILL` on hardware that lacks the feature — and not
necessarily at startup: `-C target-feature` emits no GNU ISA-needed property, so
this configuration gives you no guaranteed load-time check, and it traps
whenever execution first reaches an emitted instruction, which can be well into
serving traffic. A clean startup is not a compatibility check.

An application that *does* control its deployment target can take about a fifth
of the per-message instruction count on the Signal paths by setting it itself:

```toml
# <your app>/.cargo/config.toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = ["-Ctarget-feature=+bmi2,+avx2"]   # append to what this key holds
```

Cargo takes rustflags from exactly one source — `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`, then
`RUSTFLAGS`, then `target.<triple>.rustflags`, then `build.rustflags` — and they
never combine, so setting `RUSTFLAGS` for any reason discards the entry above.

Confirm every deployment target reports both features first, by feature check
rather than by the CPU's year or its product name: the Silvermont, Goldmont,
Jaguar and Puma cores have neither (Goldmont and Puma are outright later than
Haswell), while other parts sold under the same Atom/Celeron/Pentium names do
have both. Use an OS-filtered report such as `/proc/cpuinfo` — AVX2 also needs
the OS to have enabled YMM state, which a raw CPUID feature bit does not tell
you. The build machine needs both features too unless you pass an explicit
`--target`, since without one cargo applies these flags to build scripts and
proc macros as well.

Measurements per flag, the CPU floor each one raises, why `+adx` and
`-Ctarget-cpu=native` are not worth taking, and the `wasm32` equivalent are in
[`agent_docs/build_flags.md`](agent_docs/build_flags.md).

### One dependency is enough

`whatsapp-rust` re-exports the whole stack, so you never need to declare the sibling crates (`wacore`, `wacore-binary`, `waproto`, `whatsapp-rust-tokio-transport`, `whatsapp-rust-ureq-http-client`, `whatsapp-rust-sqlite-storage`) yourself, including when pinning a git revision:

```toml
[dependencies]
whatsapp-rust = { git = "https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust", rev = "<commit>" }
```

- Protobuf types: `whatsapp_rust::waproto::whatsapp` (aliased as `wa` in the prelude)
- Core protocol/types: `whatsapp_rust::wacore`, `whatsapp_rust::wacore_binary` (`Jid` is also at the crate root)
- Bundled implementations: `whatsapp_rust::transport::TokioWebSocketTransportFactory`, `whatsapp_rust::http::UreqHttpClient`, `whatsapp_rust::store::SqliteStore`, each behind its default-on cargo feature (`tokio-transport`, `ureq-client`, `sqlite-storage`)

With `default-features = false`, pick only what you need (e.g. `features = ["tokio-runtime", "tokio-transport", "ureq-client"]` for a custom store while keeping the bundled networking).

To run the bot in the background instead of blocking, use `spawn()` and keep the handle:

```rust,no_run
use whatsapp_rust::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let bot = Bot::builder()
        .with_backend(SqliteStore::new("whatsapp.db").await?)
        .build()
        .await?;

    let handle = bot.spawn(); // full Client API stays available via handle.client()

    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    handle.shutdown().await; // graceful: flushes pending state, then stops
    Ok(())
}
```

Run the included demo bot:

```bash
cargo run --example demo                              # QR code only
cargo run --example demo -- -p 15551234567            # Pair code + QR code
cargo run --example demo -- -p 15551234567 -c MYCODE  # Custom pair code
```
