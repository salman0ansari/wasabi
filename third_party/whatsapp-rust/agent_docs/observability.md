# Observability & Per-Session Metrics

How to measure what one client session costs (memory, I/O, CPU) — including
several clients inside the same process — and the design rules any extension
must follow.

## Design rules

- **Runtime/platform agnostic.** Everything in `wacore::stats` builds on every
  target (Tokio, wasm32, ESP32): counters are `portable_atomic`, CPU metering
  reads the pluggable `wacore::time` monotonic clock, task instrumentation
  wraps the `Runtime` trait. Never add a Tokio/allocator/`tracing` dependency
  to this layer — platform-specific mechanisms plug in from the application
  through the hooks.
- **Zero overhead when unused, no feature gates.** Always-on counters are one
  relaxed `fetch_add` on paths that already do AEAD + a transport write.
  Report code runs only when called; unused public report methods are removed
  by fat LTO (the binary-size CI proves it, see `binary_size_ci.md`). This is
  why there is no `debug-diagnostics`-style feature: dead code elimination
  replaces the cfg-gates.
- **No PII.** Snapshots and reports carry numbers only, never JIDs/phone
  numbers, matching the `wacore::telemetry` label rules.

## The four surfaces

### 1. `Client::stats()` — wire I/O counters (always on)

`wacore::stats::SessionStats`, owned by each `Client`. Recorded at exactly two
chokepoints:

- **Sent**: the noise sender task (`NoiseSocket::with_observers`) after the
  transport write — post-noise wire bytes (frame header + AEAD tag included).
- **Received**: the read loop (`node_io.rs`) per `DataReceived` batch.

That sent chokepoint is the *only* place every post-handshake frame crosses (the
XX/IK exchange writes to the transport directly, before this socket exists). Two
functions reach it — `send_raw_bytes` and `send_raw_bytes_burst` — and everything
else funnels through one of those: `send_node` and every IQ through the first,
the ack and delivery-receipt workers through the second. `send_raw_bytes`
deliberately bypasses node logging and sent-node waiters, so anything that has to
see everything the client sends on the session socket belongs at the chokepoint
and nowhere else.

`Event::SentFrame` is the other thing wired into it
(`Client::acquire_sent_frame_forwarding()`, lease-gated like `RawNode`): it hands
over the marshaled plaintext of each frame the transport accepted. Both halves
travel to the socket as `SendObservers`, so the next observer plugs in there
instead of widening `do_handshake` again.

It also owns the activity timestamps the keepalive dead-socket watchdog reads:
`last_data_received_ms` (one clock read per received transport event, plus one
more when that event carries several frames, so a slow drain is not read as
silence) and `first_send_since_recv_ms`, which every frame loads but only the
send that arms or re-arms the anchor spends a clock read on. There
is deliberately no "last send" timestamp: nothing in the core reads one, and it
cost a clock read on every frame written, which is the client's hottest path
and a call out of the module on wasm32/embedded. `frames_sent` answers "is it
still sending?" for free. Message-level counters piggyback on the existing
`telemetry::send`/`recv` chokepoints; reconnect attempts are counted in the
run loop. VoIP relay sockets pass `SendObservers::default()` and are not counted
— this is the main WA session socket only.

#### Devices a send could not key

`devices_unkeyed_no_bundle`, `devices_unkeyed_session_setup`,
`devices_unkeyed_rejected`, `devices_unkeyed_fetch_failed` and
`devices_unkeyed_encrypt` (sum: `StatsSnapshot::devices_unkeyed_total()`) count
failed attempts to obtain key material for one device. Usually the device is then
dropped and the send continues, which is parity with WA Web and is not up for
change; what these answer is *how often it happens*, which is the difference
between "the session repair worked" and a screenshot of a chat stuck on
"Waiting for this message".

**Per attempt, not per delivered stanza**, and the distinction is not academic:
a batch-wide `406` and a `Required` distribution that cannot reach every target
both abort the send, and both are counted. Skipping them would make the metric
quietest exactly when keying is failing hardest, and on the `Required` path the
session layer would have to learn the caller's error policy to know whether its
own failure "counts" — which would make the number depend on who called it. A
retry that fails the same way counts again, the same way `messages_sent` counts
attempts.

The reasons are disjoint, which is the only property worth defending here: a
device the server named is counted as a rejection and never also as a missing
bundle, and a batch-wide `406` is counted once per device it answered for
instead of as N absent bundles. That batch case has its own reason
(`refused_batch`) rather than borrowing `rejected_406`, because the refusal
names nobody: a registered device can sit in a refused batch, so reporting it
as a named rejection would dress an attribution up as a fact. A fetch that never
answered at all — timeout, dropped socket, 429/5xx — is `fetch_failed` for the
same reason, and it is counted rather than skipped because a best-effort group
send swallows that error and distributes to nobody: the metric has to be loudest
during an outage, not silent. A local session store that cannot answer at all is
`session_lookup`, counted for every device in the fan-out, since that error
takes the whole plan with it (it shares `devices_unkeyed_session_setup` in the
snapshot — both are the session phase failing to produce a session — and keeps
its own label, because it points at local storage rather than at the peer).
`wacore::send::encrypt` reaches the counters through
`SendContextResolver::on_unkeyable_devices` (like `on_local_identity_change`,
since a spawned encrypt task holds no borrow of the client);
`Client::fetch_and_establish_sessions` records its own directly.

The last drop point is the encrypt fan-out itself: `push_raw_result` skips a
device whose `message_encrypt` fails, which is where an unusable *stored*
session surfaces — the failure session repair exists for, and the one nothing
upstream can see, because `has_session` says a session is there. That is
`devices_unkeyed_encrypt`, and it is the one counter that points at local state
rather than at the server.

Getting it disjoint is why `SessionPlan` carries the devices it already gave up
on **by name**. Testing the error instead does not work: libsignal reports a
degenerate stored session as `SessionNotFound`, identical to a device that has
no session at all, so an error-shaped rule would suppress exactly the case worth
counting. The list is empty on any send that keyed everyone, so the membership
check costs nothing there. Two consequences worth knowing:

- A `SessionPlan::assume_ready` plan (the voip offer) names nothing, because it
  gave up on nothing — so a missing session at encrypt *is* counted there, which
  is right: no setup pass ran to count it first.
- A session-establishment task that dies with the runtime cannot join the list
  (the task took the device's identity with it), so that drop is deliberately
  left to the encrypt fan-out to count instead of being counted twice.

One thing these do **not** measure, known and not a bug to fix by tightening the
counter: **distinct devices**. A cold DM runs session establishment twice — the
`ensure_e2e_sessions` preflight, then `encrypt_for_devices_into` — so one send
can record the same device twice, or record a failure the second pass then
recovers from. Counting only at the final fan-out would blind the paths that
never reach one (retry handling, primary-phone establishment) and would make the
number depend on which caller reached the session layer.

`StatsSnapshot` carries totals only. The per-code breakdown lives on the
`metrics` facade (`wa_unkeyable_device_total{reason}`), whose label set is
closed: `406` keeps its own label because it is the one code that changes
behavior, and everything else buckets by class. Formatting a code into a label
would be an allocation per dropped device on the SKDM fan-out and an unbounded
label set on the backend.

### 2. `Client::memory_report()` — retained memory (on demand)

Walks every internal collection and returns entry counts plus estimated
retained bytes (`MemoryReport`, per-collection `CollectionStats`). Byte
figures come from the `wacore::stats::HeapSize` trait:

- Signal records use their protobuf encoded size (`SessionRecord::
  estimated_size`, buffa `compute_size` — no encode buffer allocated).
- Collections sum key/payload capacities (`GroupInfo`, `DeviceListRecord`,
  `LidPnEntry`, `ResolvedGroupDevices`, ...).
- Store-backed caches (Redis etc.) report `bytes: 0` — their entries are not
  process memory.
- In-flight history sync reports queued/running task count, retained compressed
  payload storage, and lifetime peaks. Inline payloads count while queued;
  external payloads contribute their `Vec` capacity once materialized.

Semantics: honest estimates for attribution and leak detection, not
byte-exact accounting. The e2e `memory_soak.rs` logs the byte totals next to
RSS; its growth-bound assertions are on entry counts.
When a new cache is added to `Client`, add it to `memory_report()` (the common
`MemoryReport::collections()` list or its feature-gated report section) and —
if it can dominate memory — implement `HeapSize` for its value type next to that
type's definition.

With the opt-in `plugins` feature, the report also includes installed plugins,
active install/connection tasks, retained connection generations, core-event
subscriptions, custom-event endpoints, and unique queued payload bytes. Fanout
shares one envelope, so queued payload memory is counted once even when several
endpoints retain it.

### Plugin host snapshots (opt-in)

`Client::plugin_stats()` is computed only when called and returns lifecycle,
health, task, subscription, and custom-event counters keyed by public manifest
ID. `PluginEventRouter::stats()` provides endpoint capacity, current unique
queue retention, and cumulative delivery/backpressure totals; publishers can
read their own totals through `PluginEvents::stats()`.

Health is sticky for the lifetime of the host: lifecycle errors/panics,
timeouts, spawned-task panics, task-drain timeouts, isolated core-event panics,
resource teardown panics, publication failures, and queue drops mark only the
responsible plugin as degraded. Concurrent snapshots are intentionally
approximate, and carry no message content, JIDs, or phone numbers.

### 3. `Client::device_memo_stats()` — group-path memo outcomes (always on)

`DeviceMemoStats`: per-term hit/miss counts for the two device-list memos a
group send depends on, `resolve_group_devices_memoized` and
`resolve_skdm_targets_memoized`. Cumulative for the client's lifetime;
`DeviceMemoStats::since` subtracts an earlier snapshot to scope a workload.

The reason it is per-term rather than a hit/miss pair: the group memo has three
validity terms (entry present, `GroupInfo` `Arc` identity, topology generation
— with a scoped re-stamp between the last two) and the SKDM memo has four stale
terms (device `Arc`, sender-key-map `Arc`, map generation, sending identity)
plus the entry-absent condition, which is why it reports five miss counters. An
aggregate "N misses" cannot separate an in-place cold flip from a metadata
refresh from a memo that was never stored, and those have different fixes. It
also cannot separate cause from consequence: the SKDM memo compares the `Arc`
that the group memo returned, so **a group-memo recompute forces
`skdm_targets.miss_devices` no matter what**. Read the group half first.

Two counters do not fit the "one per call" shape and are documented as such:
`restamps` (served like a hit, but paid the `unchanged_for` scan first) and
`not_stored` (a resolution whose target set was neither empty nor
own-devices-only, so nothing was memoized). `not_stored` guarantees the next
call **cannot hit** — not that it reports `miss_absent`. A stale entry that was
already there is deliberately left in place, because it can never become valid
again (the sender-key map generation only moves forward, the map `Arc` is
replaced wholesale on a rebuild, and the device-set `Weak` keeps the old
allocation alive so no `ptr::eq` can spuriously match), so the next call
reports whichever term is still failing. Reading a run of `not_stored` as
eviction pressure is therefore the wrong conclusion: it means the group is not
settling into the warm steady state at all.

Every other SKDM outcome is exactly one per call, including `resolve_failed`,
which covers the calls that never reached a memo term because the device
resolution they depend on errored. Without it `hit_rate()` would look healthy
over a denominator that quietly shrank as sends started failing.

Why always-on rather than `#[cfg(test)]` like `dm_devices_memo_recomputes`: a
test counter answers the question in a fixture, and the question here is what a
*deployed* client gets — an embedder whose registry writes are noisier than any
fixture's would have no way to see its own hit rate. It costs one indexed
relaxed `fetch_add` per resolver call, twice per group send. Measured against
the tightest thing the counters sit inside (SKDM target resolution on the
memo-hit path, callgrind, min of 3, K=10001 so the fixture's setup jitter
divides away): **+16 Ir per resolve at 8 members, +25 at 512**, against 4,419
and 4,408 without them. At whole-send scale it is under the fixture's own
run-to-run spread.

Record the outcome **on the branch that decided it**. An earlier revision
classified into an enum and then matched on it again to act; that second
dispatch, plus moving the SKDM memo entry (a five-field tuple carrying a `Jid`
and a `Vec<Jid>`) into a temporary to classify it, cost 126 Ir per resolve
instead of 16. A counter meant to be free on the hit path has to be written
that way.

### 4. `BotBuilder::with_task_instrument` — CPU / custom attribution (opt-in)

`wacore::stats::TaskInstrument` is an object-safe enter/exit hook called
around every poll of the client's internal tasks and around its blocking
work. Wiring: `build()` wraps the runtime in `InstrumentedRuntime`, so all
spawns through the `Runtime` trait are covered without touching call sites.
The `Option` is resolved once at `build()` — `None` (default) leaves the
runtime untouched, so there is no per-spawn or per-poll cost when unset.
Installed, the decorator costs one allocation per spawn: `Runtime::spawn`
takes and returns an erased future, so wrapping it changes the type and needs
a fresh box. Nothing else on the path allocates: `MeteredFuture` is generic
over the future it wraps, and `Bot::run` stack-pins its own.

- `CpuMeter` (built-in): busy time (direct CPU proxy) + poll count via
  `wacore::time::Instant`. Works on wasm/embedded once a monotonic provider
  is registered.
- Custom hooks: allocator attribution (see `examples/alloc_tracking.rs` for a
  dependency-free pattern; `tracking-allocator` slots in the same way),
  ESP-IDF `heap_caps` sampling, etc. The library never learns what the hook
  does.

Scope caveats: the hook covers tasks spawned *by the client* through the
`Runtime` trait, plus the main run loop itself — `Bot::run` meters its own
future (`Bot::spawn` reaches it via `Runtime::spawn`), so the read loop is
covered on either launch path. Work executed on the caller's own task (e.g.
awaiting `send_message`) belongs to the caller — instrument that side
yourself if you need it. The `voip` feature's media tasks (call driver,
relay I/O) currently spawn directly on Tokio and are not instrumented.

## `Client::resource_report()` — out-of-client resource attribution (on demand)

`memory_report()` accounts only for the **client's own** in-process
collections (tens of KiB). The real per-session cost lives mostly **outside**
the `Client`: the storage backend, transport buffers + TLS/noise state, the
HTTP pool, and transient heap. `resource_report()` (`ResourceReport`) composes
all of these into one estimate. Same design rules: runtime/platform-agnostic,
zero cost when unused (LTO drops it), no PII.

How big "per-session" is depends on the backend, and the two profiles differ
enough that quoting one figure misleads (`memory_soak.rs` covers growth over
time, `process_footprint.rs` below covers the marginal cost of one more
client):

| profile | marginal RSS per session |
| --- | ---: |
| `InMemoryBackend` | ~530 KiB |
| `SqliteStore` (defaults) | ~530 KiB + ~512 KiB of storage |

Those are gross RSS, which is the pessimistic number; read the next section for
why the actionable part is `RssAnon` and how much smaller it is.

So the SQLite page cache **is** the single largest chunk, but only on the
SQLite profile, and it is roughly half the total rather than all of it. A
process on a remote or in-memory backend still pays the other ~530 KiB, of
which the largest named pieces are the prekey window the backend retains
(~104 KiB for the default 812 keys, but see the caveat below: that figure is
`InMemoryBackend`-only) and the transport's WebSocket + TLS buffers (64 KiB).
The HTTP idle pool used to belong on that list; the version fetch no longer
leaves one behind (see below), so a session whose only HTTP traffic is that
fetch pays nothing for it.

### Four measured per-session costs, and which of them survive scrutiny

Each of these was measured as marginal `RssAnon` in release against a control
that does everything except the thing being measured. Two of the four figures
that a call-site heap profile suggested did not survive that control, which is
the reason for measuring against one.

| what | measured | now |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| HTTP: pooled TLS connection from the version fetch | 88 KiB | 0 KiB (#1243) |
| noise: batch buffer after one 60 KiB frame | 60 KiB, vs 8 KiB small-traffic | 8 KiB (#1246) |
| transport: retained `ClientConfig` | 14 KiB | 9 KiB (#1245) |
| topology log preallocation | 4 KiB | 0 KiB (#1244) |

**The prekey window is a backend artifact, not a per-session cost.** Building a
client and generating the default 812 prekeys, against a control that builds the
same client and generates none: `InMemoryBackend` 28 → 132 KiB, file-backed
`SqliteStore` 432 → 448 KiB. So the keys cost ~104 KiB of heap in memory and
~16 KiB on SQLite, but the SQLite client starts 404 KiB higher, so moving
backends relocates the cost rather than removing it, into page cache that
`RssAnon` counts and does not reclaim. The 104 KiB is also not waste: 58.7 KiB
of it is the single `Vec::with_capacity(gen_count * 74)` in `upload_pre_keys_pass`
staying alive because the `Bytes` slices handed to `store_prekeys_batch` *are*
what the backend stores (one allocation instead of 812), and 41 KiB is that
map's `RawTable` at 1024 buckets. Nothing to optimise; do not re-derive it.

That 41 KiB deserves one clarification, because a heap profiler hands it to you
under a name that invites the wrong fix. dhat attributes the final table to
`hashbrown::RawTable::reserve_rehash`, the frame that happened to allocate it,
so a per-session diff reads "41.0 KiB in reserve_rehash" and looks like rehash
churn. It is not: 1024 buckets × (`size_of::<(u32, PreKeyEntry)>()` + 1 control
byte) = 41,984 B is the table that *stays*, and the intermediate tables are all
freed before the process peak. `store_prekeys_batch` does reserve for the batch
length (#1270), which cuts the call from 11 allocations / 84.1 KB to 3 / 42.1 KB
and its in-call transient high-water from 63.1 KB to 42.1 KB — but retained is
bit-identical at 42,072 B either way, because the final table is the same size.
Reserving is worth it for the allocator traffic; it will never move the 41 KiB.

**The rustls session cache is 5 KiB, not 44.** A whole retained
`default_tls_connector()` measures 14.0 KiB; disabling resumption entirely takes
it to 9.0 KiB, and sizing the store for the one host a factory dials takes it to
9.4 KiB. The other 9 KiB is the config plus the webpki root store.

### Should a residency probe be permanent?

No, and the reason generalises. Every finding above that was worth guarding
turned out to have a **deterministic** guard available, and each of those is
strictly better than an `RssAnon` assertion:

- the HTTP pool, by counting accepted TCP connections against a keep-alive
  fixture (`an_ordinary_request_reuses_the_pooled_connection` and its
  `Connection: close` twin);
- the noise batch buffer, by extracting the release decision into
  `should_release_batch_buffer` (#1246) and testing it directly; the wire-level
  test could not see the buffer at all, and passed with the whole feature
  deleted;
- the topology log, by asserting the bound and the floor rather than the bytes.

An `RssAnon` assertion is page-quantised (the topology log's 8 KiB allocation
shows up as a 4 KiB delta, because `with_capacity` reserves without writing),
allocator-dependent, and needs a ceiling wide enough that it only catches
order-of-magnitude regressions. The probe's value was in *finding* the numbers,
not in re-checking them. Write one when you need a number; reach for a
deterministic observable when you need a guard.

To rebuild one: read `/proc/self/status`, construct N of the thing under test in
a loop while holding them all alive, and read the tail.

Keep the **median** there, as `process_footprint.rs` does, whenever the
per-step delta is comfortably above the 4 KiB page: it resists the outlier
steps, and the 88 KiB, 60 KiB and 14 KiB figures above are medians and are not
affected by what follows. It stops working once the per-step delta is within a
small multiple of the page, because then every step rounds to the same one or
two page counts and the median reports that rounding rather than the cost. The
topology log is the example: 8 KiB allocated, deltas alternating 32 and 36 KiB,
median moving by exactly one page. The **mean over the same tail** is the
sharper read there, and the two still agree on the answer: the median put the
saving at 36 -> 32 KiB, the mean at 34.9 -> 31.1 KiB.

Give each variant its own process (`--exact`, or nextest, which forks per
test): RSS never shrinks, so a second variant measured in the same process
reuses the first one's freed heap and reads as ~0. That one is not a rounding
artifact but a wrong answer, and it made a real 14 KiB cost look like 0.4 KiB
until the variants were re-run separately.

The pieces (each an `Option`-only struct in `wacore::stats`, filled only with
what a component can introspect — absent means "not reported", not zero):

- **Storage** — `DeviceStore::resource_report() -> StorageResourceReport`. A
  **defaulted method on the existing `DeviceStore` sub-trait** (next to
  `snapshot_db`), NOT a new `Backend` supertrait: `Backend` is blanket-impl'd,
  so a new supertrait would force every backend (incl. external) to add an impl,
  and an inherent method wouldn't compose through the `Arc<dyn Backend>` the
  client holds. A default on an already-implemented sub-trait gives both —
  composable *and* non-breaking. SQLite reports `min(cache cap, db size)` (an
  upper bound on the page cache; Diesel doesn't expose the raw handle needed for
  `sqlite3_db_status`), plus the DB page count. Remote backends report
  `memory_bytes: Some(0)`. `InMemoryBackend` sums its own maps (table
  allocations plus the heap its keys and values own), which is exact rather
  than a cap, because every byte it holds is this process's heap.
- **Transport** — `Transport::resource_report() -> Option<TransportResourceReport>`,
  a defaulted method (clean here — `Transport` isn't blanket-impl'd). The Tokio
  WebSocket transport fills best-effort static estimates (tokio-websockets and
  rustls don't surface live buffer sizes).
- **HTTP** — `HttpClient::resource_report() -> Option<HttpResourceReport>`,
  defaulted. With the default agent the `ureq` client reports `Some(0)`
  connections and `Some(0)` pool bytes until its first request, then its
  idle-pool buffer estimate. ureq allocates per connection, not per agent
  (`LazyBuffers` and the pool both start empty), so an agent that has never
  connected costs ~2.8 KiB of RSS against the 96 KiB the cap advertises, and
  reporting the cap there put ~28% of a session's `total_estimated_bytes()` on
  memory that was not resident. `Some(0)` rather than `None` because an empty
  pool is a measured fact, not an absence of introspection. Once a request has
  gone out the cap is a floor, not a ceiling: a pooled TLS connection measures
  ~98 KiB, of which the 32 KiB of ureq buffers is all this field claims. That
  post-request estimate is a latch and deliberately not a timer: ureq expires an
  idle connection only when a later request touches the pool, so the bytes stay
  resident for exactly as long as the latch keeps claiming them. It overreports
  in one case — when the request that finally purges pools nothing itself, a
  second version fetch a day later say — leaving an empty pool the latch still
  reports as the cap. A
  custom agent reports `None` throughout — its buffer sizes are opaque, and
  since agents share one pool with all their clones it may already have
  connected before the client wrapped it, so its pool is not knowably empty
  either.
- **Alloc churn** — an `AllocSnapshot` from an `AllocMeter` (below), when one is
  installed.

`ResourceReport::total_estimated_bytes()` sums the **retained** components
(client + storage + transport + HTTP) and is documented as a **lower bound**;
`alloc` is churn, not residency, and is excluded. The future is `Send` (compile
guard in `accessors.rs`, per #964) so multi-session consumers can await it off a
worker.

### The version fetch does not leave a connection behind

`connect()` fetches `sw.js` over TLS through `version::resolve_and_update_version`
unless `with_version` is set or the cached version is under 24h old, so a session
that never touches media still opens one TLS connection. A pooled connection is
retained until something touches the pool again — `max_idle_age` (15s by
default) is enforced lazily, inside `ConnectionPool::connect` and
`Connection::reuse`, so an idle connection ages out on the next request and not
a moment before — and the next fetch for that device is a day away, so the
connection would sit resident for the whole session buying nothing. Measured at **88 KiB of `RssAnon` per session** (median over 16
agents, release, against a keep-alive TLS server).

`fetch_latest_app_version` therefore sends `Connection: close`, which ureq acts
on itself rather than waiting for the server to agree: `ureq-proto` records a
`ClientConnectionClose` reason at request-build time and drops the connection at
cleanup instead of pooling it. Measured marginal after the change: **0 KiB**.
Media requests are deliberately untouched — there the pool is what makes the next
range request cheap.

`mark_if_dispatchable` treats such a request as non-pooling, so a session whose
only HTTP traffic is the version fetch keeps reporting an empty pool instead of
latching onto the 96 KiB cap. It matches ureq's rule byte for byte rather than
RFC 9110's token list: ureq compares the whole `Connection` value to `close`, so
reading `keep-alive, close` as closing would report an empty pool for a
connection ureq had in fact pooled.

### Sharing one HTTP client across sessions

Still available, and now worth it for a process with pooled HTTP traffic —
media, in practice: build one `UreqHttpClient` and hand a clone to each
`BotBuilder::with_http_client`. Cloning
shares the `ureq::Agent`, and therefore the connection pool, so idle CDN
connections are paid once for the process instead of once per session.

Isolation: media URLs carry their auth per request and the client sends no
cookies (the `cookies` feature is off), so a shared connection carries nothing
between sessions that the shared source IP does not already carry — except TLS
session resumption, which lets a server link two sessions even across a source-IP
change. That is the reason sharing stays opt-in rather than the default.
Concurrency is unaffected: ureq opens a new connection whenever no idle one
matches the authority, so the pool caps idle retention, not throughput.

### `AllocMeter` — per-client allocation attribution (opt-in)

`wacore::stats::AllocMeter` is a first-class `TaskInstrument` (sibling of
`CpuMeter`) that attributes bytes allocated/freed to a client — the churn
counterpart to the point-in-time retained reports. The host installs a
`#[global_allocator]` that calls `AllocMeter::on_alloc`/`on_dealloc`; the meter,
installed via `BotBuilder::with_alloc_meter` (or `with_task_instrument`), marks
per thread which client's poll is running so the charge lands correctly.
`examples/alloc_tracking.rs` is the ~20-line reference.

Attribution boundary (documented honestly on the type): only allocations inside
instrumented polls/tasks are counted (the run loop is covered since #963; work
spawned raw on the runtime — some voip/media paths — is not). Deallocations are
charged to whichever meter is active at free time, so `allocated` (churn) is the
reliable signal and `freed`/`net` drift for buffers that outlive their poll.

### `SqliteStoreConfig::mmap_size` — page-cache tuning knob

`mmap_size` (new optional field, default `None` = current behavior; builder
`with_mmap_size`) emits `PRAGMA mmap_size`, moving reads to reclaimable,
file-backed pages — useful for a process holding many small per-session DBs. WAL
caveat: mmap covers reads of the main DB file; writes still go through the WAL.

## Per-message allocation on the group stanza build

**Read the scope before the numbers.** These come from
`wacore/benches/send_receive_benchmark.rs`, whose `run_group_send` calls
`prepare_group_stanza` and marshals the resulting node — and nothing else. The
client send path around it (group lookup, retry caching, sender-key cache
access, `resolve_skdm_targets_memoized`, persistence-adapter construction, the
send itself; `src/send/mod.rs`) is not in the measured region. A whole-client
per-message profile is a strictly larger quantity and these figures cannot be
subtracted from one or compared against one.

Measured with `divan::AllocProfiler` installed as the global allocator
(temporarily — see below), 50 samples per bench, pinned to one core. Divan
tallies only the benchmarked closure, so the fixtures' setup is excluded; the
identical counts across group sizes confirm that.

| stanza build | allocations | bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `bench_dm_send` | 157 | 27.9 KB |
| `bench_group_send_10` (no distribution) | **22** | **3.58 KB** |
| `bench_group_send_50` (no distribution) | **22** | **3.58 KB** |
| `bench_group_send_256` (no distribution) | **22** | **3.58 KB** |
| `bench_group_send_skdm_256` (distributing, first message) | 6,816 | 675.1 KB |

**The result that holds regardless of scope: a group send that distributes no
sender key is flat in group size.** 22 allocations and 3.58 KB whether the group
has 10 members or 256, because the stanza carries one `<enc type="skmsg">` for
everyone and nothing per recipient (pinned by
`warm_group_send_encoding_scale` in `wacore/src/send/tests.rs`). The DM figure
is higher because a DM pairwise-encrypts once per recipient device; the group
path is cheaper per message precisely because sender keys exist.

**What the distributing row is, precisely.** It is *not* X3DH:
`setup_group_send` calls `establish_session` for every member before forcing
distribution, so `ensure_sessions_for_devices` finds each session present and
never reaches the prekey-fetch branch. A cold fixture with genuinely missing
sessions would cost more, and nothing here measures that.

It is also not the shape a *later* redistribution takes. `establish_session`
runs `process_prekey_bundle` alone — unlike `establish_bidirectional`, it never
completes the round trip — so every session still carries its `pending_pre_key`
and each SKDM encryption emits a `pkmsg`, with first-message prekey wrapping and
device-identity serialization attached. So 6,816 is the **first-message fan-out
at 256 targets**, ~26.6 allocations each. A forced rotation or reset over
acknowledged sessions emits plain `SignalMessage`s and is cheaper; that number
is unmeasured here.

Note "targets", not members: `setup_group_send(n)` creates exactly one device
per member, while SKDM fan-out scales with *resolved devices*. A real group
resolves to more devices than members, so member counts cannot be substituted
into these figures without that topology.

### What this does not settle

An external profile of a client reported 387 allocations per group message at
128 members. These numbers neither reproduce nor refute it, and the earlier
revision of this section was wrong to present them as doing so:

- **Different scope.** 387 came from a full client send; 22 is stanza build plus
  marshal. The missing work is real and unmeasured.
- **Different configuration.** The no-distribution fixture has no own companion
  device. On a linked account, own devices are *never* memoized warm — see the
  comment at `src/send/mod.rs` in the `initial_targets` match, which spells out
  that own-only SKDM needs **is** the warm steady state. Such a send carries a
  nonempty `distribution_list` on every message and *does* call
  `ensure_sessions_for_devices`. So the 22 figure is specifically the
  zero-own-target case, and "a warm send never touches session setup" is false
  for the ordinary multi-device account.
- **The amortization arithmetic does not land on 387 either.** Scaling the
  measured row down to 128 *targets* gives ~3.4K; one of those plus nine
  22-allocation sends averages ~360, not 387. And the external figure is quoted
  in group *members*, whose device count is not stated — a 128-member group
  resolves to more than 128 targets. The shape is suggestive; the decomposition
  is not claimable from here.

`send::encrypt::ensure_sessions_for_devices` is worth naming because a profile
points at it: it is reached only through the `distribution_list` branch, so a
send with no SKDM targets skips it entirely — but as above, an account with a
companion device has targets on every send.

One correction to make in passing, because the earlier revision got it backwards:
`resolve_skdm_targets_memoized` does **not** govern how often sender keys are
redistributed. It memoizes device-set *resolution*, skipping the per-member
registry fan-out on a repeat send. Which devices still need the key is decided by
`filter_skdm_targets` against the `SenderKeyDeviceMap`
(`device_and_primary_warm`). That map is the state to look at for redistribution
frequency; the memo is a lookup cache in front of a different question.

To re-measure, add the allocator to the bench temporarily rather than
committing it:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: divan::AllocProfiler = divan::AllocProfiler::system();
```

It is deliberately *not* checked in for `send_receive_benchmark`. Swapping the
global allocator changes the timing of every bench in that file, which would
put a one-time step through each of their CodSpeed series for a number that is
only wanted occasionally. `voip_benchmark.rs` and `prekey_store_benchmark.rs`
do carry it, because there the allocation churn is the thing under test.

## Fixed process cost vs per-session cost

A process that runs one session pays far more than a process that runs ten
divided by ten. `tests/e2e/tests/process_footprint.rs` measures the split:
`client_construction_footprint` (no mock server needed) for what a `Client`
costs before it talks to anything, `session_footprint_fixed_vs_marginal` for a
connected, paired, synced session. Both build N clients in one process
(`FOOTPRINT_CLIENTS`, default 16) and log a per-client table plus first /
second / median-marginal deltas.

Report the marginal and the fixed number, never the average over N: the average
is dominated by the first client and hides the very asymmetry the split exists
to expose.

Read the `anon` column. `/proc/self/status` splits RSS into `RssAnon` and
`RssFile`, and the first client's RSS delta is overwhelmingly `RssFile`: the
executable's own text and rodata faulted in the first time each code path runs.
That is bounded by the binary, shared by every session in the process, backed by
the page cache rather than by the allocator, and roughly 3.5x smaller under the
release profile than under `dev`. Anonymous growth is the part a consumer can
act on, and it is two orders of magnitude smaller.

Two consequences for anything measured this way:

- A one-off RSS jump on a path's first execution is not a leak and not
  attributable to the session that happened to run it first. Compare against a
  control step that does no work at all; in `dev` builds a single `println!`
  moves `RssFile` by ~2 MiB.
- Static tables (the binary protocol token maps, `webpki-roots`) never appear in
  `anon` at all, and the protobuf descriptor is consumed at build time, so none
  of them scale with sessions. The lazily built codec tables under the `voip`
  features do: they are `OnceLock` heap, process-wide, and only materialize once
  a call is encoded.

### Reading a heap profile next to it

`--features dhat-heap` (in `tests/e2e`) attributes retained bytes to call
sites, which the footprint numbers cannot. Three things about that profile are
easy to read backwards:

- **dhat sees only the Rust global allocator.** SQLite's page cache comes from
  the amalgamation's own `malloc`, so it never appears in a heap profile at any
  size, and a profile taken on SQLite looks the same as one taken in memory.
  The storage report and `RssAnon` are the only places it shows up.
- **Its end-of-run `curr_bytes` is a leak metric, not residency.** The profiler
  outlives the clients it profiled, so that figure describes what survived
  teardown. Residency is the peak-time figure, or a `resource_report()` taken
  while the clients are still connected.
- **The report cannot reach RSS, by construction.** Against a counting global
  allocator, glibc's anonymous RSS runs ~1.1x live heap, so
  `total_estimated_bytes()` is a lower bound on `RssAnon` before any component
  under-reports at all. Closing that last tenth is not a goal.

Not everything is expressible. The noise sender task's batch buffer grows to
`MAX_BATCH_WIRE_BYTES` and lives as a local inside a spawned task, so nothing
can read it without a channel built for the purpose; it stays unreported rather
than guessed. The safety net for the parts that *are* reachable is
`tests/report_coverage.rs`, which parses `Client`'s fields and fails when one
that reaches a collection — in its own type, or through one crate-local type it
names, aliases resolved — never reaches `memory_report()`. Resolution stops at
one level on purpose: `self_weak: Weak<Client>` makes the type graph reach every
collection from every field, and a guard that flags everything flags nothing.
Fields past that boundary are listed in the file's `EXEMPT` with their reason.

## Per-client retention and cache bounds

Two questions a multi-session consumer asks that the sections above do not
answer directly: what does one more `Client` retain before it does anything, and
which of its collections can a workload or a peer grow without limit. Both were
audited in full; this is the result, so nobody re-derives it.

### What one client retains at construction

Measured at the global allocator (`tests/e2e/tests/per_client_retention.rs`,
`#[ignore]`d, 16 clients, median of the tail) rather than in `RssAnon`, because a
2 KiB structure and a 3 KiB one both round to the same page count. Identical
under `dev` and `release`:

| what | retained |
| --- | ---: |
| `Client` + `UreqHttpClient` | 24 267 B |
| + `InMemoryBackend`, empty | 26 211 B |

Quote the pair, not the two halves: ureq materializes part of its agent lazily,
so a few hundred bytes land on either side of the boundary between building the
HTTP client and building the client that takes it, and the split moves between
runs while the sum holds to within a handful of bytes. The client's own share is
~22.4 KiB and the HTTP client's ~1.9 KiB, which is the right granularity to
reason at and the wrong one to regression-test.

Against that, the two preallocated bounded queues a session owns:

| queue | capacity | payload | retained |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `major_sync_task_sender` (`Client::new`) | 32 | 56 B | 2 816 B |
| transport events (`EVENT_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`, per connection) | 64 | 40 B | 3 840 B |

So the sync queue is ~11% of a constructed client — but a connected session's
marginal cost is ~530 KiB (see the table further up), against which both queues
together are ~1.2%. **Neither is worth making lazy.** The sync queue's receiver
is handed to `Bot::build` to spawn its worker, so deferring the allocation means
an `Option` plus a builder handoff that no longer has a receiver to give; the
transport queue is created by the transport at connect, and every connected
session drains it. Paying an indirection on a per-connection path to defer 0.5%
of a session is the wrong trade.

**A capacity cap is a bound here, not a reservation.** `PortableCache` starts on
an empty `HashMap`: capacity 1 and capacity 10 000 both retain 248 B until
entries arrive (pinned by `cache_capacity_is_not_preallocated`). Raising a cap
costs nothing at construction, which is why the coordination caches can afford
to be sized generously.

### Bytes vs. object graphs, and first-use allocation

Both already hold, so neither is an open question:

- The retry cache (`recent_messages`) is `Cache<ChatMessageId, Arc<Vec<u8>>>` —
  encoded protobuf, never a `waproto::` graph — and its default capacity is 0,
  so the DB is the only copy unless a consumer opts into the L1.
- First-use allocation is already the pattern for everything whose cost is worth
  deferring: `group_cache`, `app_state_processor`, `delivery_receipt_queue`,
  `transport_ack_queue` and `custom_enc_handlers` are `OnceLock`s built on first
  use, not in the constructor.

The one place decoded protos are retained is `inbound_commit_batch`, and there
the decode is the point: the entries are dispatched to the consumer and handed
to the durability hook as `wa::Message`. Re-encoding them to save bytes would
add a decode per delivery to a path that already holds the batch for
milliseconds. It is bounded at 400 messages / 4 MiB instead — a *flush
threshold*, not a hard ceiling: `maybe_flush_inbound_commits` checks it after the
entry is inserted, so a batch overshoots by its last message, and one very large
message can overshoot substantially on its own.

### What is bounded, and by what

| collection | bound | what eviction costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `group_cache` | 1h TTL, 250 | re-query on miss |
| `device_registry_cache` | 1h TTL, 5 000 | store stays authoritative |
| `recent_messages` | 5m TTL, 0 (disabled) | DB is authoritative |
| `message_retry_counts` | 1h TTL, 500, FIFO | a forgiven `MAX_DECRYPT_RETRIES` — see below |
| `undecryptable_dispatched` | 5m TTL, 1 000 | a duplicate event |
| `pdo_pending_requests` / `pdo_requested` | 30s TTL, 200 / 24h TTL, 512 | a repeated PDO request |
| `sender_key_devices_cache` | 1h TTI, 500 | a redundant SKDM |
| `session_recreate_history` | 1h TTL, 256 | one un-throttled recreate |
| `session_locks` / `chat_lanes` / `group_distribution_locks` | 10 000 / 5 000 / 512 | nothing: an `evict_guard` refuses to evict a lock a task holds, so the map briefly exceeds capacity instead of minting a second lock for one key |
| `resend_rate_limiter` | 4 096, FIFO | fail-open by design — an evicted bucket is recreated full, so undersizing forgives rate, never over-throttles |
| `group_devices_memo` / `skdm_warm_memo` / `dm_devices_memo` | 64 / 64 / 512 | a recompute |
| `SignalStoreCache` sessions / identities / sender keys | 2 000 each (+1/8 slack before an eviction scan), *while flushes succeed* | nothing: only *clean* entries are evicted, so an unpersisted record is never dropped — which also means a backend that stops accepting writes leaves everything dirty and the maps grow past the cap. Correct, and the reason to watch the counts rather than trust the number |
| `SignalStoreCache::sender_key_locks` | 2 000, idle-only | nothing: only locks held solely by the map are dropped |
| `inbound_commit_batch` | 400 messages / 4 MiB, checked after insert | commits early, no loss; overshoots by one message |
| `msg_secret_buffer` | 4 096, except on cancellation | nothing: a producer that would exceed it parks on `capacity_available`, and a cancelled one force-buffers past the mark rather than losing captures |
| device-topology changed-users log | 256 | a memo recompute; overflow can never serve stale data |
| `AbPropsCache` | the compile-time `WATCHED` interest set | server props outside it are discarded at parse |
| `CallRegistry` pre-offer controls / ringing group calls / event queues | 64 entries or 1 MiB each | fail-closed admission |
| `PendingCallLinkJoins` transitions | 32 | fail-closed |
| `major_sync_task_sender` / transport events / noise send jobs | 32 / 64 / 8 | backpressure, no loss |

### What is unbounded, and why it stays that way

Every one of these except the last reaches `memory_report()`, which is the point:
the bound is a drain or a lifecycle, so the count is the only warning available.

- **`lid_pn_cache`** — deliberate, and pinned by a test. Evicting a still-valid
  mapping silently downgrades Signal addresses to `@c.us`; WA Web's
  `WAWebLidPnCache` is plain `Map`s with no expiry either.
- **`app_state_key_requests`** — swept by deadline (`retain`) on every insert
  path, so a busy client holds only key ids whose retry deadline has not passed.
  The sweep is lazy, not timed: a client that requests keys and then goes idle
  keeps those stamps until the next request or a reconnect clears the map. No
  capacity cap, because dropping a stamp either re-asks the phone for a key
  already requested or loses the dedup that keeps a stuck sender from re-asking
  every few seconds. Growth is self-limiting anyway: each new key id costs a peer
  message on the wire.
- **`pending_device_sync`** — one entry per distinct user seen with an unknown
  device. Offline entries are drained by `doPendingDeviceSync` at the end of the
  backlog; entries the *online* path adds are removed only by that same drain or
  by teardown, so a connection that never drains keeps them for its lifetime,
  which also suppresses a second immediate refresh for those users. A cap would
  skip a device refresh and leave the next send to that user addressed to a stale
  device list, so the fix if this ever matters is a removal on the online path,
  not a ceiling.
- **`AppStateProcessor::key_cache`** — expanded app-state keys, one entry per
  distinct key id the server's patches reference, with no cap and no TTL;
  emptied only by `clear_key_cache` on reconnect. The backend stays
  authoritative, so unlike the three above a cap here would be *safe* — nothing
  has measured how many distinct keys a real account accumulates, which is why
  it reports a count instead. It lives in `wacore`, which is why the coverage
  guard now parses that crate too.
- **`pending_retries`** — held only for the duration of one retry receipt (a
  `scopeguard` removes it), so the bound is concurrent receipts.
- **`presence_subscriptions`**, **`response_waiters`**, **`node_waiters`**,
  **`sent_node_waiters`**, **`stanza_interceptors`** — one entry per thing the
  *application* asked for. Not a peer-driven growth vector.
- **`transport_ack_queue`** / **`delivery_receipt_queue`** — unbounded
  `async_channel`s whose depth is a stalled-transport signal; capping them would
  drop acks the server is waiting for.
- **`offline_receipt_buffer`** — drained at the end of every offline batch, and
  one of two things here the report does *not* count: it is listed in
  `report_coverage.rs`'s `EXEMPT` because its `MessageInfo` values are already
  attributed where the batch owns them. Its depth during a drain is therefore
  invisible; if that ever matters, it needs a field of its own rather than a cap.
- **The drain commit's encode arena** — the other unreported one, and the only
  entry on this list that is not a collection: a `Vec<u8>` reused across drain
  commits. `commit_inbound_batch` clears it but keeps its capacity, so one
  oversized message leaves that capacity resident for the rest of the session.
  Unreported because sampling it means taking a lock a commit holds across its
  backend write. Sizing it is a shrink-after-use question, not a cap question.

Two design rules the audit confirmed, and one place where the second does not
hold as tightly as the code comments suggest:

1. **A cap must not evict state something is relying on.** The `evict_guard` on
   the coordination caches and the clean-only eviction in `SignalStoreCache` are
   the same idea applied twice: exceed capacity rather than break an invariant.
2. **A rate limiter should fail closed, not evict.** `message_retry_counts` is
   what enforces `MAX_DECRYPT_RETRIES`, and forgetting a counter forgives the cap
   it exists to apply. Its 1h TTL is chosen for exactly that (a 5m TTL expired
   between reconnects, so the count never reached the cap) — but its 500-entry
   capacity is a plain FIFO eviction with no guard, so **more than 500 distinct
   retry keys inside the hour does forgive the ceiling**: the evicted key's next
   decrypt failure re-enters `increment_retry_count` on the `None => 1` arm.
   Left as is deliberately — the counters are two integers, so the honest fix is
   a larger capacity rather than a mechanism, and no workload has been measured
   against 500 concurrent retry keys. Recorded here so the next person measures
   instead of re-deriving.

## Relation to the `metrics`/`tracing` features

`wacore::telemetry` (cargo feature `metrics`) emits process-global counters
through the `metrics` facade — no per-client dimension, by design (label
cardinality). The `stats` layer is the per-client dimension: snapshots you
poll and export however you like. `examples/multi_session_metrics.rs` shows
two clients in one process reporting independently.
