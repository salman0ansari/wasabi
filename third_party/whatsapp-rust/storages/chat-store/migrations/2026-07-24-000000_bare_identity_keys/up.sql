-- Fold rows written under a device-suffixed JID (`user:48@lid`) onto the bare
-- identity every lookup uses.
--
-- Receipts were the one event that reached the store with the peer's wire
-- identity intact, so a companion device's traffic was filed under keys
-- nothing reads: phantom chat rows, one read-by row per device instead of per
-- participant, and contact names the bare lookup never finds. The writers
-- normalize now; this heals what they left behind. A chat, contact or
-- participant key never legitimately carries a device, so `LIKE '%:%@%'`
-- selects exactly those artifacts.

-- Phantom chats. Only a receipt could key a chat by device and messages always
-- landed on the bare thread, so these are empty; the guard keeps a row that
-- somehow owns messages rather than orphaning them.

-- Contacts. An existing bare row wins (a live path wrote it with the same or
-- newer data); otherwise the device-keyed names carry over to it. Two devices
-- of the same peer can disagree, so the newest row is inserted first and the
-- rest lose to it — OR IGNORE resolves in SELECT order, which makes the pick
-- deterministic instead of scan-dependent.
