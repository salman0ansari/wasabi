    ///   [`SqliteStoreConfig::pool_size`] decides the number — so at its
    ///   default of 1 their writes serialize against each other, and a base
    ///   store built with a wider pool passes that width on instead. That is

    ///   backoff (measured: ~2x spread between the fastest and slowest
    ///   session). So this is for fleets that are mostly idle — the shape
    ///   sessions actually have — and not for continuously writing ones.
    ///   [`SqliteStoreConfig::read_pool_size`] widens the *read* side only,
    ///   and its connections are shared here too.
    /// - **Split the resource report.** `resource_report()` describes the
