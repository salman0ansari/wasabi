//! Coalesced write-behind for the inbound Signal cache flush.
//!
//! The live receive path used to flush the whole dirty Signal cache to storage
//! once per stanza — a session re-serialize plus a SQLite transaction per
//! message, dominated by the record the ratchet re-dirties every time. Routing
//! it through here collapses a burst of receives into one flush per coalescing
//! window.
//!
//! Scope and durability model (deliberate, bounded):
//! - The receive path coalesces: a lost receive-side advance re-derives
//!   forward (the Double Ratchet receiving chain derives `CK_n → CK_n+1`), and
//!   a consumed one-time prekey stays buffered until its session is durable, so
//!   a crash inside the window is recoverable. The SEND path coalesces too
//!   whenever its advance is covered by a durable counter lease (see
//!   `SessionRecord::reserve_sender_chain_counters`,
//!   `SenderKeyRecord::reserve_iterations`, and
//!   `Client::persist_signal_state_pre_wire`); only a send that raises either
//!   lease still flushes
//!   synchronously before the wire, because reusing an outbound counter would
//!   reuse its message key + IV.
//! - The offline drain, retry recovery, identity-change recovery and teardown
//!   keep their own synchronous flushes: those gate acks, receipts or
//!   follow-up reads on durability and are not routed here.
//!
//! Single-flight scheduler: at most one worker per generation. The first
//! request arms it; requests that arrive while it runs only mark it dirty
//! (never spawn a second worker for that generation), and it re-runs one more
//! window if so. A failing flush is retried by that same worker with
//! exponential backoff, so a backend outage cannot be reset to the base delay
//! by concurrent traffic. Across a reconnect a stale worker and the new
//! generation's worker can briefly coexist; the stale one stands down at its
//! generation check. Actual backend writes are additionally serialized against
//! teardown's cache settle by the `signal_flush_lifecycle` gate, so at most one
//! flush is ever mid-write — see `Client::signal_flush_lifecycle`.
