//! Typed recovery over the error chain.
//!
//! [`ErrorChainExt`] answers a few questions about any error without the caller
//! knowing its concrete type, so it need not walk [`std::error::Error::source`]
//! itself nor learn that three different types can carry a server rejection. It
//! is a read-only view with a blanket impl: a domain error added later answers
//! the same questions without implementing anything, and no new error type or
//! parallel hierarchy exists.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use whatsapp_rust::ErrorChainExt;
//!
//! # fn demo(err: whatsapp_rust::features::GroupError) {
//! if let Some(rejection) = err.server_rejection() {
//!     eprintln!("server said {}: {}", rejection.code, rejection.text);
//! } else if err.is_transport_unavailable() {
//!     eprintln!("offline, will retry");
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! From an `anyhow::Error`, annotate the cast: it carries two
//! `AsRef<dyn Error>` impls and both are covered here.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use whatsapp_rust::ErrorChainExt;
//! # fn demo(err: whatsapp_rust::anyhow::Error) {
//! let cause: &(dyn std::error::Error + 'static) = err.as_ref();
//! let _ = cause.server_rejection();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Only questions the crate already answers internally are exposed. There is
//! deliberately no "invalid input", "protocol violation" or "internal" query:
//! each domain spells those as its own `InvalidRequest(String)`-style variant
//! with no shared representation, so any such split would be invented here
//! rather than recovered. [`crate::features::MexError::ExtensionError`] is
//! likewise not reported as a server rejection: its `code` is a GraphQL
//! extension code, a different space from the IQ `code` attribute, and merging
//! the two would make the number meaningless.
//!
//! An HTTP status is kept apart from an IQ `code` for the same reason, but it
//! *is* recoverable — under its own question, [`ErrorChainExt::http_status`].
//! The media paths refuse a CDN or upload host on a status the caller often has
//! to act on differently from a stanza rejection, so the fact is modelled; what
//! is avoided is one accessor that answers for both layers and leaves the
//! caller unable to tell which refused.
//!
//! # Rendering
//!
//! A wrapping variant renders exactly what it wraps, so each error's own
//! `Display` is unchanged. A caller that concatenates the whole chain will see
//! consecutive nodes repeat the same sentence, which is the price of keeping
//! the wrapped error downcastable. Print the innermost cause, or collapse equal
//! neighbours, rather than joining every node.
