//! Write-behind buffer for inbound `messageSecret` persistence.
//!
//! Capturing a secret used to upsert SQLite synchronously inside the per-chat
//! receive lane, before the ack and the `Event::Messages` dispatch. The buffer
//! splits visibility from durability: an insert is immediately readable
//! through [`MsgSecretWriteBuffer::lookup`] (so an add-on referencing the
//! secret of the stanza just processed always finds it), while the backend
//! upsert happens on a detached drain task that coalesces a burst of captures
//! into one batched `put_msg_secrets` transaction.
//! A fixed high-water mark bounds unique pending keys; reaching it waits for
//! the in-flight batch instead of allowing a slow backend to grow the map.
//!
//! Entries leave the buffer only after the backend write returns, so a reader
//! sees every secret either in the buffer or in the store, never neither. A
//! failed write drops its entries with a warning, the same data-loss semantics
//! the previous awaited write had. The only durability change is the window
//! between ack and flush: a process crash inside it loses those secrets, which
//! matches WA Web (IndexedDB persistence is asynchronous there too).
