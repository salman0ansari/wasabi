//! Offline fixture for the client-level group-send benchmarks.
//!
//! `wacore` can be benchmarked directly because it is pure; the client crate
//! cannot — a send touches the transport, the store, the device registry and
//! the async runtime. This module builds the smallest thing that still runs
//! the *real* [`Client::send_message`] group path end to end with no server:
//!
//! - transport: a sink that drops the bytes the noise socket hands it. The
//!   stanza is still marshalled, framed and encrypted, so everything up to and
//!   including the wire write is measured; only the socket write is elided.
//! - store: [`wacore::store::InMemoryBackend`], so a measurement is not
//!   dominated by SQLite. The SQLite backend's own cost is therefore **not**
//!   covered here.
//! - registry / group metadata: pre-seeded into the in-process caches, as a
//!   client that has already resolved the group holds them. No usync or
//!   group-info IQ is issued, which is also why no IQ response has to be faked.
//!
//! Everything a real client resolves once and holds across sends — the
//! `Arc<GroupInfo>`, the resolved device set, the sender key, the warm marks —
//! is established in [`GroupSendHarness::new`](crate::bench_support::GroupSendHarness::new),
//! outside anything a benchmark measures. That is deliberate: PR #1279 found that building an N-participant
//! `GroupInfo` *inside* the measured body was the entirety of the apparent
//! per-member growth in the `wacore` benchmark. A fixture that scales with the
//! sweep parameter measures the fixture.
//!
//! Only compiled under the non-default `bench-harness` feature.
