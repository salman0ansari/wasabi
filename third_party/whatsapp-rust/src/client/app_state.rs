// ─── #1157: the app-state send path must read the server's answer ───────────
//
// `w:sync:app:state` enforces optimistic concurrency on the collection's
// `version`. A patch built against a stale base is not rejected at the IQ
// level: the IQ succeeds and the failure is reported *inside* it, as
// `<collection type="error"><error code="409"/>`, carrying the patches that
// won. WA Web reads exactly that (`WAWebSyncdResponseParser`, fn `h`) and maps
// it onto `CollectionState.Conflict{,HasMore}`; the collection then goes
// through `applyAppStateSyncResponse` like any other, and `serverSync` re-queues
// it for another round as long as pending mutations remain — so the mutation is
// re-sent on the winner's base instead of being dropped. `400`/`404` map to
// `ErrorFatal`, anything else to `ErrorRetry`.
//
// These tests pin what the send path must make of each response shape: a 409 it
// can resolve (rebuild and resend), a 409 it cannot (an error, after exhausting
// the rebuild attempts), a fatal code (an error, not retried), and a response
// carrying no collection verdict at all (accepted). Discarding the response —
// which is what made a 409 indistinguishable from success — fails all four.
