//! LID-PN (Linked ID to Phone Number) mapping methods for Client.
//!
//! This module contains methods for managing the bidirectional mapping
//! between LIDs (Linked IDs) and phone numbers.
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Cache warm-up from persistent storage
//! - Adding new LID-PN mappings with automatic migration
//! - Resolving JIDs to their LID equivalents
//! - Bidirectional lookup (LID to PN and PN to LID)
