//! Inbound commit batcher: accumulates decrypted messages during the offline
//! drain and commits them per batch — pending-inbound buffer, Signal-cache
//! flush, durability hook, event dispatch and acks all amortize over the
//! batch. Mirrors WA Web's `MessageProcessorCache` (`createSnapshot`: bulk
//! message-table write → bulk signal-store commit → aggregate receipts), with
//! the same flush triggers: batch size, timeout, and end-of-drain.
//!
//! Live messages bypass accumulation and commit as a batch of one, which is
//! also WA Web behavior (the same pipeline with an immediate flush).
