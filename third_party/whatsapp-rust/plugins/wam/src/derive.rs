//! One rule governs every function here: a field is written only when its value
//! follows from something this client actually saw. Where the official client
//! fills a field from state this library does not keep (a chat's unread count,
//! a message's reply target, the size of a device list), the field is absent,
//! and `parity.rs` proves that the ones that *are* written are ones WA Web
//! writes too.
//!
//! Everything here reads the stanza envelope, never the decoded message. That is
//! not only a privacy rule (no JID, phone number, message id or body can reach a
//! buffer if the body is never opened) but a correctness one: the envelope
//! attributes are what the official client's own receive metrics are built from.
