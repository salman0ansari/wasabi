//! Optional metrics emission via the [`metrics`](https://docs.rs/metrics) facade.
//!
//! Off by default: the `metrics` cargo feature pulls the dependency. With it off
//! every function here is an empty `#[inline]` no-op and [`Timer`] is a zero-sized
//! type that reads no clock, so there is no dependency and no runtime cost.
//!
//! The library only *emits*; the application installs a recorder (Prometheus,
//! OTLP, ...). See `examples/metrics.rs`.
//!
//! Labels are strictly low-cardinality categorical values (outcome, kind,
//! namespace, ...). Never put a JID, phone number or message id in a label: it
//! would explode the metrics backend and leak PII. Durations are unlabeled
//! histograms (the matching `_total` counter carries the categorical breakdown).

/// Histogram metric names, used with [`timer`].
