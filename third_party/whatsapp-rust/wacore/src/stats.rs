//! Per-session resource accounting: wire I/O counters, retained-memory
//! estimation and a runtime-agnostic task instrumentation hook.
//!
//! Everything here is dependency-free and portable (wasm32/ESP32): counters
//! use `portable_atomic`, CPU metering reads the pluggable
//! [`crate::time::Instant`] clock, and nothing knows which executor or
//! allocator the host application uses.
//!
//! Cost model:
//! - [`SessionStats`] is always on: one relaxed `fetch_add` per wire frame,
//!   on a path that already does AEAD crypto plus a transport write.
//! - Clock reads: zero per frame sent while the dead-socket anchor is armed,
//!   one on the send that arms it, one per received transport event, plus one
//!   more when that event carries several frames. A new timestamp field here
//!   buys a read on the client's hottest path and needs a reader to justify it:
//!   one direct message arrives as roughly four transport events (the message,
//!   its ack, the receipt, the receipt's ack), so per-event is per-message x4.
//! - [`HeapSize`] / memory reports only run when called; unused report code
//!   is dropped by fat LTO.
//! - [`TaskInstrument`] is resolved once at client build: unset leaves the
//!   runtime untouched. Only an installed instrument pays the per-poll hook.
