//! LID-PN (Linked ID to Phone Number) Types
//!
//! This module provides types for mapping between WhatsApp's Linked IDs (LIDs)
//! and phone numbers. The cache is used for Signal address resolution - WhatsApp Web
//! uses LID-based addresses for Signal sessions when available.
//!
//! The cache maintains bidirectional mappings:
//! - LID -> Entry (for getting phone number from LID)
//! - Phone Number -> Entry (for getting LID from phone number)
//!
//! When multiple LIDs exist for the same phone number (rare), the most recent one
//! (by `created_at` timestamp) is considered "current".

use std::sync::Arc;

/// The source from which a LID-PN mapping was learned.
///
/// The source is load-bearing, not just provenance: it selects the write
/// policy applied when the pair reaches the cache — see `lid_pn_write_policy`
/// in the `whatsapp-rust` client, which mirrors WhatsApp Web's
/// `createLidPnMappings` `switch (learningSource)`. Directed sources overwrite
/// on any change; observational bulk sources (`Other` and friends, WA Web
/// `"other"`) only seed new LIDs and re-resolve conflicts via a live query;
/// known-stale sources are stamped `created_at = 0` so they never outrank a
/// fresher mapping for the same phone (the PN→LID resolution direction; the
/// LID→PN reverse map always takes the latest write).
