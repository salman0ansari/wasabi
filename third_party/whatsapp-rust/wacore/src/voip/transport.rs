//! The VoIP relay-transport seam: a dumb packet pipe to one WhatsApp relay endpoint, mirroring
//! `wacore::net::Transport` for the media plane. The relay carries STUN/RTP/RTCP as opaque binary
//! messages; this trait knows nothing about that framing. Reads are push-based (an
//! `async_channel::Receiver` of events), exactly like the main connection's transport.
//!
//! The platform implements it: native wraps the webrtc-rs DataChannel, the WASM bridge wraps a
//! Node `dgram` socket (JS owns the socket; drop on overflow since VoIP is loss tolerant), and an
//! embedded consumer could wrap a UDP `Conn`. The sans-IO `CallEngine` never touches this trait; the
//! shell pumps `PacketReceived` events into `handle_input` and runs `Output::Transmit` via `send`.
