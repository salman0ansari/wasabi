//! Optional packet-capture tap over the [`RelayTransport`] seam,
//! for debugging a live call. It decorates a transport/factory to record every packet crossing the
//! seam -- both directions -- into a pluggable `PacketTap` sink, WITHOUT touching the engine, the
//! driver, or the codec (the seam is the only interposition point). The sink is any `PacketTap`
//! impl: a file dump, a pcap writer, an in-memory buffer, a logger, a network forwarder. This is the
//! "transport-decorator dump" the design notes left as a follow-up -- modular and consumer-driven,
//! and zero cost when not wired (you simply don't wrap the transport).
